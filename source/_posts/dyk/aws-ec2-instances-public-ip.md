Did you know an Amazon EC2 instance retains its private IP addresses when it is stopped?  This is not the case for the public IP address which is released when the instance is stopped.

For more information on Amazon EC2 Instances IP addressing see: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html>
